This is the changelog for libsoldout project.
Please note that this is a user-centered condensed changelog; for an
exhaustive list of changes, please consult the repository, I don't see the
point of duplicating this information here, while on the other hand I have
often missed a simple change list containing only what affect users of
release versions.


## Changes from v1.2 to 1.3 ##

  * New example renderer that outputs LaTeX.


## Changes from v1.1 to v1.2 ##

      + various issues with matching emphasis delimiter have been fixed

## Changes from v1.0 to v1.1 ##

  * New features:
      + new callbacks for document prolog and epilog,
      + support of PHP-Markdown-like tables, through 3 new callbacks.

  * Several bug fixes, most notably:
      + span-level entities are now correctly recognized in headers,
